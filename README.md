# Quizera

Welcome to **Quizera** – a fun and interactive quiz game where you can test your knowledge! The app challenges users with randomly selected questions, and each time you play, you get a new experience.

## Features

- **User Input**: The quiz begins by asking for the user's name.
- **Randomized Questions**: Each time you start, 10 questions are selected randomly from a pool of questions.
- **Time-Limited Answers**: You have 20 seconds to answer each question, or you'll automatically receive a score of 0 for that question.
- **Built with React**: The app is developed using React to provide a seamless and dynamic user experience.

## How It Works

1. **Enter Your Name**: The quiz starts by asking for your name to personalize your experience.
2. **Answer 10 Questions**: You’ll be presented with 10 randomly generated questions from a pool.
3. **Time Limit**: You have 20 seconds per question. If time runs out, the answer is automatically considered incorrect, and you score 0 for that question.
